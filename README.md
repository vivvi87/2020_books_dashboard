# 2020_books_dashboard
This repository contains the code of the dashboard I built to visualize my 2020 reads (Dashboard.Rmd). The books I read and related info are collected in the dataset Books_2020.csv.

The dashboard is hosted on RPubs at: https://rpubs.com/vivvi87/books_2020.

The dashboard is built using Flexdashboard (dashboard output format of Rmarkdown) and contains interactive graphs built using plotly and leaflet.
